# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of the
repositories in this organization, please report it to us through coordinated
disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues,
discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please report a vulnerability
via [our security advisories page](https://github.com/the-ensign-company/the-ensign-company/security/advisories),
or email [security@the.ensign.company,](mailto:security@the.ensign.company) and
we will raise a vulnerability on your behalf.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us
better understand and resolve the issue:

* The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site
  scripting)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
